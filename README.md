### What I learned

i learned how to use transform property on background image it can be done with following CSS code

```css
/* container that u want to set background for */
.laptopBg{
    width: 50%;
    position: relative;
    height: 100%;
}
.laptopBg::before{
    content: "";
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  top: 0;
  background: url('/images/illustration-laptop-desktop.svg')no-repeat;
  background-size: 121% 100%;
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

### Continued development

  i did fail at making menu for mobile screen i did manage to make it in the end but it in my opinion looks really bad so i will try to work on making better menus in future ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
